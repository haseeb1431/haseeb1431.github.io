##GitHub Pages
Today i have configured the jekyll mark down parser to use for my user github pages. Actually github provides you with the opportunity host your project pages and an individual user domain e.g. [yourName.github.io](http://haseeb1431.github.io). I have used jekyll among many other options to set up my personal account github pages. You can write content using pre defined markup and it will be parsed into the static content.

# {{ "# is used for H1" }} 


**Jekyll is a parsing engine and {{ "** is used for boldness " }}.**


`jekyll --server`


**Developers like Jekyll because we can write content like we write code:**

- Ability to write content in markdown or textile in your favorite text-editor.
- Ability to write and preview your content via localhost.
